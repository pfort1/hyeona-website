      text_one: AT&T was struggling to connect with multicultural millennials. And to
        change that, we launched a campaign that doesn't advertise a single
        phone. Instead, we celebrated the cultural meaning behind different area
        codes and tapped into the undeniable pride that comes along with the
        3-digit codes.
      text_two: >-
        What does it mean to rep the (212), (404), (312) or (310)? We started
        the conversation through billboards, short films, live events, radio
        campaigns, meme generators, brand partnerships and much more.
