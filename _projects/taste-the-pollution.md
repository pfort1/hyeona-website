      text_one: Adnams' beers taste so good because everything they do is
        environmentally conscious. But there’s no way for beer lovers to taste
        and understand the benefits of all natural, environmentally conscious
        beer.

        Well, what if we gave beer drinkers a chance to experience how pollution
        could affect their beloved beverage of choice? Adnams presents “Taste
        the Pollution", an exclusive flight of 6 beers brewed to polluted
        perfection.
