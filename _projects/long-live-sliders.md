      text_one: White Castle is loved by those who know it, but known by too few —
        it’s a “cult” brand. Their goal was to welcome more people into the fold
        with a new brand campaign. We wanted to go beyond the perception of
        White Castle as a restaurant, or a logo on a box, by reimagining it as a
        community.

        “Long Live Sliders” is an on-going brand campaign that celebrates what
        makes White Castle (and their Cravers) unique. By being proudly
        original. We brought this idea to life through online videos, POS
        designs, social posts, digital assets, print design, brand partnerships,
        and more.

          ### If burgers are 9 to 5, sliders are 5 to 9. And we mean 5pm to 9am.
          You know, when the fun stuff happens.


          ### Sliders are passionate… edgy… and they dance like no one’s watching.
