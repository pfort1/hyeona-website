      text_one: White Castle is loved by those who know it, but known by too few—it’s
        a “cult” brand. Their goal was to welcome more people into the fold with
        a new brand campaign. We wanted to transcend the perception of White
        Castle as a restaurant, or a logo on a box, by reimagining it as a
        community.

        “Long Live Sliders” is an on-going brand campaign that celebrates what
        makes White Castle (and their Cravers) unique. By being proudly
        original. We brought this idea to life through online videos, POS
        designs, social posts, digital assets, print design, brand partnerships,
        and more.

      text_one: We created vignettes around “Sliders” doing things authentically their
        way by being unafraid, unconventional, and unapologetic. Because if
        burgers are 9 to 5, sliders are 5 to 9. And we mean 5pm to 9am. You
        know, when the fun stuff happens. Sliders are passionate… edgy… and they
        dance like no one’s watching.

        visual identity – branding, photography direction, social media look &
        feel, etc.
